“Catch a Fish to saves the world” is a simple, interactive, beginner-friendly web game where users click fish swimming across the screen to remind you to save the world. Each fish caught shows a short message suggesting a kind act, promoting positivity and engagement. The game also includes a score counter to track how many fish you have caught. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and requires no backend.
